# Time-Series Vehicle Listing Analysis

This repository contains a Python notebook focused on transforming a provided record-level dataset into a time-series model. The primary objective of this model is to gain insights into the temporal patterns of vehicle listings, with a specific emphasis on conducting an inventory analysis over time, segmented by regions. The notebook facilitates the creation of time-series charts representing the number of available vehicles over time, filtered by criteria such as region and vehicle type. These analyses aid in understanding regional demand-supply dynamics, seasonal trends, and other relevant insights.

## Contents

1. **Time-Series Model Notebook**: The main Python notebook file (`time_series_model.ipynb`) contains the code and documentation for transforming the dataset and conducting the analysis described above.

2. **Data Enrichment Recommendations**: A Google Doc (`data_enrichment_recommendations.pdf`) is provided, detailing areas of additional data that would enhance the analysis. This document explains why this data is essential and the types of analyses it would enable.

3. **Data Warehouse Structure Proposal**: Another Google Doc (`data_warehouse_structure.pdf`) outlines a proposed design for a data warehouse structure. This design integrates the existing dataset with newly proposed data sources, considering the needs of different stakeholders, promoting efficient data usage, and scalability for future needs.
